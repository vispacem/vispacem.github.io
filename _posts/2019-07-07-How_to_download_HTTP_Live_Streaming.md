**HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)** is an HTTP-based media streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. **HLS** lets you deploy content using ordinary web servers and content delivery networks. It is designed for reliability and dynamically adapts to network conditions by optimizing playback for the available speed of wired and wireless connections

To download HSL stream I use [The-New-M3U8-Downloader](https://github.com/vispacem/The-New-M3U8-Downloader)  running on a Windows computer.

An **m3u8** file or **m3u8 playlist** file is used by various audio and video playback programs. **M3U8** files use the same formatting as .M3U files, except the text stored in the files uses *UTF-8 character encoding*.

I made an artifact in [appveyor.com](https://appveyor.com)  so maybe you can download it from <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vispacem/the-new-m3u8-downloader/build/artifacts>

I got rid of all taskbar stuff. If you want it go to the original.

You will see the program with chinese labels. Feel free to fork it and made your own translation if you are not comfortable using it in that way.

You are going to need the program ffmpeg.exe inside the folder Tools.  Search for it in sourceforge for example. 


To use it just paste the **HSL url** at the top left box of the program. And then press the big button at the left bottom corner.

Now you may be asking yourself "how I get the **HSl url**?" . To do that I use an extension for *Chrome* (also available for *Firefox*) called [Video DownloadHelper](https://www.downloadhelper.net).

There are a lot of watch online sites to see movies or TV series, but the one is attract my attention right now is [https://flixtor.to](https://flixtor.to/).

[https://flixtor.to](https://flixtor.to/) do not allow you to download videos if you are not member. So I thing it's worth it to do it in this way.
