From [https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/](https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/)

[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) is arguably the best private search engine available right now. It combines great search results, customizable settings, and excellent privacy features. Startpage uses results from Google, but with added privacy protections, proxy viewing options, and no data collection.

Originally, Startpage was called [IXQuick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixquick) and was founded by David Bodnick in 1998. You can get more history about the company and their policies on their [About Us page](https://www.startpage.com/eng/what-makes-startpage-special.html).

Startpage does quite well in the area of user privacy. It does not log any user data or share information with third parties. Startpage is based in the Netherlands, which is a favorable jurisdiction for privacy compared to the United States ([Five Eyes](https://restoreprivacy.com/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes/)). Additionally, Startpage has undergone (and passed) independent [third-party audits](https://support.startpage.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/714/0/how-can-your-privacy-policies-be-verified-can-users-trust-startpage-to-do-what-it-says) of their privacy and data-handling practices.

**Proxy “Anonymous View” feature** – Another great feature with Startpage is that it includes a proxy, through which you can view images, videos, and websites. You will see an “Anonymous View” link next to every search result. Clicking this will hide your IP address and user agent, but I also found it to be somewhat buggy in testing.

**Customizable features** – In testing out the latest version of Startpage, I was impressed with all of the customizable features. Aside from language modifications, there are also different layout themes (Dark, Night, Air, etc.) and proxy viewing options for images and websites. You can also select the server region you want to use: US servers or EU servers.
