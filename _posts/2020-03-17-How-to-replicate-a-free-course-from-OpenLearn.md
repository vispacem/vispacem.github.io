## How to replicate a free course from OpenLearn to Github pages.

The **OpenLearn** site free courses are released under the terms of the *Creative Commons license*.
So this allows us to use the materials throughout the world without payment but for non-commercial purposes only.

Thanks to **Tony Hirst**:

we can easily to create a **Github** page with the content of one of these courses.

I followed the **Tony Hirst** instructions to replicate the "*Grammar matters*" course.

Here are the steps I followed:

- I created the repository *grammar-matters* and then waited for the *actions* end. 

- Next I opened the SET_UP.md file and clicked the grab unit link of "*Grammar matters*" course.

- In the issue form, I clicked the "*Submit new issue*" button, and then waited for the *actions* end.

And that's all. Now the course link is:
